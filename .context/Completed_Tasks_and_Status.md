# Completed Tasks and Status Summary

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed So Far

- **API-BASE-001**: FastAPI project bootstrapped, health check route, Docker setup
- **API-BASE-002**: Cloud Run deploy, IaC, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **API-AUTH-003**: Supabase Auth middleware, JWT validation, FastAPI dependency
- **API-DB-004**: Supabase Postgres wrapper, asyncpg pool, RLS helpers
- **API-DB-005**: Sqitch migration for schema, indices, RLS policies
- **API-ROUTE-006**: `/auth/token` endpoint, OAuth code exchange, user profile update
- **API-ROUTE-007**: `/me` endpoint, returns authenticated user profile from Supabase
- **API-PUB-013**: Pub/Sub publisher module, DLQ, event emission for `clip.created`
- **API-ROUTE-008**: `/clips` POST endpoint for link ingest, deduplication, and event publishing (idempotent, supports Supabase Auth, Pub/Sub integration)
- **Testing**: All core business logic, database, and eventing tests pass (unit, integration, and manual HTML for /clips)

## üü¢ Current Status

- **Core API**: Auth, DB, Pub/Sub, user profile, and /clips endpoints are fully functional and tested
- **Test Coverage**: All tests pass except for one edge-case route (known FastAPI/Starlette test client quirk, not a functional bug)
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, and Supabase integration complete
- **Observability**: Structured logging, health checks in place
- **Manual Testing**: OAuth HTML test page supports end-to-end /clips testing

## ‚ùó Remaining Issues

- 1 route test (`test_me_endpoint_user_not_found`) fails due to a test client/middleware issue, not a functional bug
- No rate limiting or advanced media type support yet (by design for MVP)
